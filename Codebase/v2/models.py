"""Immutable data shapes shared across providers, UI, and tests.

Every provider normalizes its on-disk records into one :class:`Session`.
Resume is modeled as a :class:`ResumeCommand` value object — providers build
it, ``resume.launch()`` executes it. That split makes argv/command
construction unit-testable without spawning a subprocess.
